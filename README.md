This repository contains Typescript based examples of many
popular algorithms and data structures with functional twist ([Functional over Imperative Programming](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/programming-guide/concepts/linq/functional-programming-vs-imperative-programming)) using [RamdaJS](https://ramdajs.com/).

## Data Structures

[From Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_structure):
In computer science, a data structure is a data organization, management and storage format that enables efficient access and modification. More precisely, a data structure is a collection of data values, the relationships among them, and the functions or operations that can be applied to the data.

## Algorithms

[From Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithm): In mathematics and computer science, an algorithm (/ˈælɡərɪðəm/) is an unambiguous specification of how to solve a class of problems. Algorithms can perform calculation, data processing, and automated reasoning tasks.
